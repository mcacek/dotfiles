# Workspace Configurations

A convention based workspace configuration loader for project/employer based configurations that are stored outside of the
default source controlled dot files respository for practical or security reasons.

## Setup

Create a directory for each workspace inside of `~/.dotworkspaces` including any of the file options listed below. The
workspace loader will handle the rest.

## File Options

* aliases
* exports
* functions
